            The computer console is a place in which we receive messages from the program. In most scenarios it is used in order to 
            show any sort of data, statistics, warning or updates. It may sound very difficult in order to write into the console
            however just typing 'console.log' and what you want to write in brackets next to it will hence allow you to write
            into the console.
